The purpose of this project is to design a hardware (PCB) header which can be used as an interface from general I/O hardware to any uC of choice.

For example, lets say we wish to measure something (voltage, current, etc). It allows us to use any micro controller (teensy, arduino, beaglebone, etc) to interface to the measurement.
